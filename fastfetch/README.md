### About

The configuration is so that when using `fastfetch` only the necessary information is displayed along with the lying cat. I use it in `.bashrc` for example. This is used if the config is inside the `.config`:

```shell
fastfetch -c ~/.config/fastfetch/fastfetch.jsonc
```

That's what it looks like:
